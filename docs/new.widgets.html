			Development of new widgets
		</h1>
		<br/>
		
		<p>
			JCC uses a very simple mechanism for extending its widgets. Basicly, you only need to add a 
			an object with 3 methods and 1 property to the 'jcc.widgets' collection where the key is the name of your widget: 
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>version</h3>
				A string containing your widget version.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<h3>can_enhance</h3>
				A method returning boolean which takes as a single argument a DOM node. It returns 'true' 
				if the node	provided can be enhanced by your widget code, or just return 'false' otherwise. The method
				will be called for each DOM node not being enahnced yet. Once it returns positive, the 'enhance' method will
				be used to enhance the node appearance.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<h3>enhance</h3>
				A method which is called once a DOM node (and eventually its children) is considered by 
				'can_enhance' to be enhanced or eventually unenhanced. It takes the node as a single argument. 
				In the implementation of this method you should apply the appropriate styles, event handling and 
				other initialization you need to the node (and eventually to its children).
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<h3>unenhance</h3>
				A method to remove all the enhancements from a node and eventually from its children. It 
				takes the DOM node to be unenhanced as a single argument and its implementation should do exactly the
				opposite of what you have done in the 'enhance' method - remove styling, event handlers and other
				initializations.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			A a sample of the mechanism is provided in the snippet below. For more details please refer to the JCC source
			code to see real implementations of widgets - all built-in widgets of JCC use absolutely the same mechanism.
		</p>

<code class="language-javascript">

{
	version : "1.0",
	can_enhance : function(el) 
	{ 
		return el.nodeName == "DIV" && el.getAttribute("data-role") == "yourWidget";
	},
	enhance : function(el) { if(el.yourWidget) el.yourWidget.refresh(); else new jcc.yourWidget(el).refresh(); },
	unenhance : function(el) { if(el.yourWidget) el.yourWidget.destroy(); }
};
jcc.yourWidget = function(el)
{
	//Inherit from base class 'widget'
	this.widget = jcc.widget;
	this.widget(el);
	
	this.refresh = function()
	{

		...
	}
