			Introduction

		<p>
			Welcome to the Jap'n'Chap Controls reference manual. This resource will guide you through the 
			working process needed to build websites and applications using the Jap'n'Chap JavaScript library.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Jap'n'Chap Controls (shortly JCC) is a compilation of flat controls used to create simplistic 
			user interfaces for mobile and desktop websites and web based applications. All controls come
			in two themes 'a' and 'b' where 'a' is the dark (default) theme and 'b' is the light one.
			You are free to change the CSS of a particular theme or add new ones.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			JCC does not depend on external libraries and is implemented fully in standard HTML, JavaScript and CSS3.
			JCC is markup oriented library which means that it will enhance speciffic blocks of your HTML code according
			to the 'role' of your HTML tags. JCC will not try to enhance your HTML automatically, though. You are
			responsible as a coder to tell JCC from which DOM-node(s) the enhancement should begin while traversing 
			the DOM tree. The enhancement process can be done any time you decide - you just provide the DOM-hirarchy 
			you want to be processed and that's it. In that way you will not collide JCC with other frameworks and libraries
			you might have used in your project.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			JCC is intended to be used only for UI controls. The main 'jcc' object has few 'framework' methods but they
			are intended to be used internally by 'jcc' or if you wish to extend it with new controls rather than use them
			in your application's code. For that purpose we strongly advise you to use other proven libraries (jQuery, Angular or
			anything valuable you like).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Each JCC widget is implemented as a plugin. Please see the manual for extending JCC on the left menu.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			JCC has few methods for alert boxes, prompts, polyfills for color and date and time picking.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			JCC is compatible and tested with: 
			<ul>
				<li>Mozilla Firefox (desktop and mobile)</li>
				<li>Internet Explorer and Edge (desktop and mobile)</li>
				<li>Safari (desktop and mobile)</li>
				<li>Chrome (desktop and mobile)</li>
				<li>Mozilla Firefox (desktop and mobile)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This reference manual is organized to be as handy as possible with all the topics within the left scrollable menu.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Our team wishes you happy times using JCC!
		</p>
